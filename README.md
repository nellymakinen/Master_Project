# Master_project

This repository is created as a complement to a paper written for my Master's thesis. The purpose of this repository is to document all code used in the project, to make it accessible and reproducible. 

The aim of the master thesis is to find bacteria and metabolites correlated to the gut microbiome and the gut-brain axis, which might aid in the future development of post-traumatic epilepsy. The goal is therefore to find potential biomarkers which explains the difference in subjects which develop epilepsy after a traumatic brain injury, in comparison to the subjects which do not develop epilepsy. 

This repository includes the finalization of different scripts written in R studio to get the results created in this project. This repository includes code and explanations of the packages used. For other method aspects, results and discussion, see the final report "Investigation of the cross-talk between gut microbes and plasma metabolites in the development of post-traumatic epilepsy" in Diva-portal.
